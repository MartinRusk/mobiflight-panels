# Analog gauge designs

This folder contains various designs for general aviation analog instruments, mostly for stepper motors and servos. If you want to contribute
to these desings:

 - faceplate designs
 - 3d models for gauges
 - circuit board designs
 - or something else related

Pleaser reach out to us on MobiFlight Discord server, on the #instruments channel - or just add a pull request if you are familiar with Git. 

## Simple styleguide for now

Let's put each file in a folder tree under the following format:

 - analog-gauges/gauge-type/aircraft-type

So like analog-gauges/airspeed/cessna-172 - lowercase and dash for space. 
And if its generic, just put some identifier, like "altimeter-inhg" or whatever 
fits. Or lets figure it out together in the chat.
