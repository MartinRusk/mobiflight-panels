Panels NOT READY:

1.  05-electrical-displays
	- missing pcb
	- text for faceplates
	
2.	13-pressure-gagues
	- missing pcb
	
3.	16-electric-transfer
	- pcb has to be fixed to accomodate double-shaft stepper motor. 
		In current design single-shaft stepper was included
		
4.	17-pressure
	-	missing pcb
	
5. 	20b-eng-start
	- missing entire engine-start mechanism
	
	
	
Things to be added:
- gauge frames (3D models)
- gauge faceplates + glass covers
- buttons (3D models)
- Rotary knobs (3D models)
- List of all switch types and their amount needed in this design
- HUB pcb for arduino boards.
- mounting brackets for panels 18 and 19
- full frame design files
- Easy-to-read Bill-OF-Materials


Things that might come (or not) in far future:
1. Rework of pcb design which will add two important advantages:
	- All components SMD
	- RP2040 chip to replace all the wiring with USB cables.
